start = xml

# ebb: How can the xml root element be empty? empty means the element is
# self-closing with nothing at all inside except maybe attributes.
# Hint: The reason that <para> elements are not allowed in your file is because
# you have not indicated that they are supposed to appear inside this element. 

h = element h {para*, text}
# ebb: Looking at your <h> element in the XML, I don't see that it contains text. 
# It does contain a <b> element, though.

# I changed some suff around and got it to work!



para = element para {mixed{(place | location | measurement | time | days | month | holidays | contact)* }}
# ebb: This is good work with representing mixed content and allowing any of these elements in any order.
# But isn't it confusing to have a <days> element and a day attribute? I think that caused some confusion
# later in your schema...You might want to revise your XML code to make it easier to follow!
# It is not usually a good idea to use element and attribute names that are very similar to each other.

place = element place {what, text}
what = attribute what {"statepark", empty}
location = element location {text}
measurement = element measurement {mixed{(long | high)* }}
long = attribute long {"2053"}
high = attribute high {"301"}
time = element time {text}
days = element days {week, text}
week = attribute week {"open" | "closed"}

# ebb: In your XML, day is an attribute, not an element.
# Also, it does not contain a week attribute since day is only an attribute.
